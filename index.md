# Himanshu Mittal's space on the Interwebs

Hi I am ___Himanshu Mittal___, a software engineer by profession and a generally curious creature. Never had any major downs in life untill recently when my father had a major heart surgery. It was the hardest 2 months of my life. 
Setting up this page as an experiment with Github Pages. Will be adding more content soon. Might make it a full fledged blog.
Cheers.
