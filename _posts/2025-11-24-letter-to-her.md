## A letter to her

Hey,
I still remember the day you walked in wearing a blazer when we first met in Gurgaon in March. 
Something clicked that day. You seemed like what I had been looking for, graceful and beautiful yet confident and able to express your own opinions.
While you had some insecurities about your non tech background and were a bit nervous just like me, we both talked well 
From then on we talked more and I learned about your simplicity, the chipkali that bothers you on the weekend, to the weekend cleaning routine and how you had set yourself up in Bangalore
I found your sense of independence and the fact that you had a fitness routine to be something I really appreciated.
And when we talked about things aligning for both of us and you said the same, something in me lit up, I felt at comfort at ease, like I may have finally found her. 
I will not deny I had my own share of past trauma to process and heal properly and throughout my journey with you I have self reflected and healed.
I was harsh with you in the beginning and didn't open up properly, though you persevered and handled things.
Gradually I started trusting you and opening up
And the past wounded self of mine who was afraid of getting hurt started to put in trust
In my conversations with you I didn't feel judged or evaluated, I felt seen and heard after a long time, someone who I could be myself
with without judgement.
That is why I probably started expecting too much from you.
I was new to Bangalore, had joined a new company, had very little network of friends here and my roommates did not speak Hindi.
Combine all this with arranged marriage setup, age and family pressure and I was definitely overwhelmed!

I realized expecting a busy corporate professional to be active on texts initially was not right, and that we should have started 
having regular calls back then itself.
We talked about taking things slower, I removed the pressure of commitment from my end and we reconciled and met up
As we met and talked more we bonded over ###filter coffee, ###south indian food, ##experiences living as a north Indian in Bengaluru, and our shared Baniya background
Something about this connection felt perfect, be it our family backgrounds (I can't connect with rich pampered kids, but also haven't 
struggled as much as kids from weaker financial backgrounds or small towns), be it our typical middle class baniya kids from Delhi waale instincts
or be it our learned corporate waali sophistication (hi-fi angrezi aate hue bhi dil se desi h ham log)
I will acknowledge that I was poor at handling people's opinions and pressure from family regarding marriage timelines
I projected my fears and you projected yours and the distance between us while in Delhi made it worse
Your texts and our calls were confusing me more and I questioned whether I was being stupid by investing my emotions in this relationship
further
To protect myself I thought it will be best if we both don't proceed, but before making a decision I didn't talk to you properly 
I acknwoledge it was a mistake, I called you up and tried to understand your perspective, put my energy back into my work and workout and started to work on fixing our communication 

We met again Bangalore at Jagriti Theatre where after a month I saw you again wearing a blue and white dress as I waited outside the theatre
You smiled at me from top of the staircase and somehow I again felt that she is here to stay in my life
We sat and talked and met again, we got things even, you put back my number and since then I have adapted to your communication
style, you have adapted to what I can feel bad about and we have been able to talk well







Mishika's chubby bui who is the chaheeti of everyone in her family 
I feel responsible to do justice to you in this life and do the best I can to take care of you and be the best version of myself
You inspire me to be my best and whatever you choose, I wish the best for you in life. 


## What can we do next? 
--Can we in a limited timeline move towards clarity, can meet max 1 or 2 times and talk it all out
- else close this chapter forever, even if we haven't found other partners the option of coming back to this is closed for both of us as that will help us be certain and clear instead of living in limbo and doubt

My introspection in this break-- 


And husband wife future together-- 
If Delhi ncr living in Shivalik colony at family home, having posh areas Saket, green park etc nearby, could go to cult classes together
We will do office work, then spend time together watching shows, or going out 
Could engage in some social work or activities over weekend, your family home would be near too so that will help 
I could talk to Rakuten to allow work from home or Noida office
Could build a friend network at work, gym etc 
Travelling Cooking playing baddy gym shows music etc  that could be routine

Network of people in the separate activities that we do, sports friends network 
EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY WILL NOT BE THERE WHEN THERE WILL BE ROUTINES AND CLARITY ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO ON DAY TO DAY BASIS



Don't let irrational fears make you lose out on something beautiful.
Don't think Living with the regret of never giving this a chance will be easy. 

 This connection made sense both from practical perspectives like age, caste, mindset, family background  as well as the emotional connect and vibes were there. A balancing act of modern thoughts with traditional values is what I could see in both of us. 




Household disputes will not be there if we communicate and share responsibilities and fine middle ground 
I have seen jin couples ki household disputes zyaada unke case mein communication broken patterns, dad became a bit lazy and mom became a bit too aggressive 
Dad could have set boundaries and taken up more responsibilities specially at rk puram 
Mom could have supported dad in having some activities after work in rk puram
And dad lost his health which took a toll on both 


What were disputes about? -
Dad not planning what to do next day, watching tv, not initiating communication
Mom not communicating what she wants
Just poor communication 


On the usual day we will be pushing each other and motivating for better work gym etc 
And then rewarding ourselves


^^ THIS VISION MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE WITH HER JUST A DREAM BUT MAYBE IF SHE'S WILLING TO LISTEN THIS NEW DREAM COULD BE SHOWN TO HER 

25 November is the last date



## her doubts I remember at the top of my head
overthinking -- only because no certainty and waste of time possible 
in uncertainty we decide immediate action items and timelines to move towards certainty 

do the things and then analyse-- to learn from mistakes
eating mindfully -- slow and chew it not with distraction

## BUT I DONT THINK THERE IS EVEN A POINT TRYING TO RESOLVE ANYTHING, SHE IS NOW NOT WILLING TO LISTEN, SAYING IT"S NOT ABOUT THIS NOT ABOUT THAT BASICALLY TO NOT ACCEPT ANY SOLUTIONS and wants to quit the relationship hence if we do initiate expect 99 percent chance of closure in negative rather than moving towards positive in 1-2 meets


Pray to god whatever is right happens 
Wish myself the best of luck
Hare Krishna
Donate some things

HE WILL GIVE YOU THE STRENGTH TO OVERCOME THESE FEELINGS
OR HE WILL GIVE HER THE WISDOM TO CHOOSE MY LOVE
IF HE IS NOT DOING THAT THAT MEANS THIS WAS STOPPED BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT LEAD TO A HEALTHY MARRIAGE
AND LONG TERM LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS SHORT TERM PAIN
