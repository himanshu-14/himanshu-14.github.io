--withion limited timeline move towards clarity, can meet max 1 or 2 times and talk it all out
- else close this chapter forever, even if we haven't found other partners the option of coming back to this is closed for both of us as that will help us be certain and clear instead of living in limbo and doubt

My introspection in this break-- 

Family pressure, age, uncertainty led me to be a bit emotional
Plus initial strangers so couldn't trust with texting disconnect
Later realized she does use phone less and text less but we speak well on calls and the distrust removed
New city new job no network here in Bangalore meant that you were my entire social network at that time, I thought I only needed a life partner but having a friend network living nearby, people to talk to in Hindi, travel with was not there
So gradually built that out along with work and gym routines plus filling routine with other activities on weekend such as learning music and badminton 
Bike trips and all

And husband wife future together-- 
If Delhi ncr living in Shivalik colony at family home, having posh areas Saket, green park etc nearby, could go to cult classes together
We will do office work, then spend time together watching shows, or going out 
Could engage in some social work or activities over weekend, your family home would be near too so that will help 
I could talk to Rakuten to allow work from home or Noida office
Could build a friend network at work, gym etc 
Travelling Cooking playing baddy gym shows music etc  that could be routine

Network of people in the separate activities that we do, sports friends network 
EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY WILL NOT BE THERE WHEN THERE WILL BE ROUTINES AND CLARITY ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO ON DAY TO DAY BASIS



Don't let irrational fears make you lose out on something beautiful.
Don't think Living with the regret of never giving this a chance will be easy. 

 This connection made sense both from practical perspectives like age, caste, mindset, family background  as well as the emotional connect and vibes were there. A balancing act of modern thoughts with traditional values is what I could see in both of us. 




Household disputes will not be there if we communicate and share responsibilities and fine middle ground 
I have seen jin couples ki household disputes zyaada unke case mein communication broken patterns, dad became a bit lazy and mom became a bit too aggressive 
Dad could have set boundaries and taken up more responsibilities specially at rk puram 
Mom could have supported dad in having some activities after work in rk puram
And dad lost his health which took a toll on both 


What were disputes about? -
Dad not planning what to do next day, watching tv, not initiating communication
Mom not communicating what she wants
Just poor communication 


On the usual day we will be pushing each other and motivating for better work gym etc 
And then rewarding ourselves


^^ THIS VISION MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE WITH HER JUST A DREAM BUT MAYBE IF SHE'S WILLING TO LISTEN THIS NEW DREAM COULD BE SHOWN TO HER 

25 November is the last date



## her doubts I remember at the top of my head
overthinking -- only because no certainty and waste of time possible 
in uncertainty we decide immediate action items and timelines to move towards certainty 

do the things and then analyse-- to learn from mistakes
eating mindfully -- slow and chew it not with distraction

## BUT I DONT THINK THERE IS EVEN A POINT TRYING TO RESOLVE ANYTHING, SHE IS NOW NOT WILLING TO LISTEN, SAYING IT"S NOT ABOUT THIS NOT ABOUT THAT BASICALLY TO NOT ACCEPT ANY SOLUTIONS and wants to quit the relationship hence if we do initiate expect 99 percent chance of closure in negative rather than moving towards positive in 1-2 meets


Pray to god whatever is right happens 
Wish myself the best of luck
Hare Krishna
Donate some things

STILL HAVING TROUBLE ACCEPTING THIS REALITY 22 NOV 
KEEP THINKING MAYBE SHE WILL COME BACK OR IF I ASK AGAIN WE CAN FIX AND MOVE THIS 
BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THIS PROBABILITY IS NOT EVEN 0.000001% 
I HAVE PRAYED AND DONE EVERYTHING 
BUT IF GOD DECIDES THIS PATH IS CLOSING
THEN HE HAS SOMETHING BETTER DECIDED FOR YOU
HE WILL GIVE YOU THE STRENGTH TO OVERCOME THESE FEELINGS
OR HE WILL GIVE HER THE WISDOM TO CHOOSE MY LOVE
IF HE IS NOT DOING THAT THAT MEANS THIS WAS STOPPED BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT LEAD TO A HEALTHY MARRIAGE
AND LONG TERM LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS SHORT TERM PAIN
